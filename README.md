# Airothon - react native AR Application

This is a basic React Native project setup with Viro.

## Note
This application displays 'Airothon 4.0' on the screen on behalf of AR model. Since online demostration via hosting is not possible, we are submitting its source code and apk in the repositary. We also pinned some screenshots with this repo  

## Prerequesites 

Set up the development environment for [react native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). 

> ⚠️ NOTE: The android emulators are not supported by Viro. See [this](https://viro-community.readme.io/docs/frequently-asked-questions#does-this-work-with-ios-simulators-or-android-emulators).

1. `git clone https://github.com/ViroCommunity/starter-kit.git`
2. `cd starter-kit`
3. `npm install`
4. `npx pod-install` (iOS)
